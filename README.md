# Simple-Banking-System
Will help you understand the concept of connecting databases in python.

This is a really suitable project for anyone who is looking to learn how the simple variables that we use in our 
day-to-day programs can be stored in a database to increase the usability of that data by many folds.

Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with a database.

In this project, I found out how new credit cards are issued by the banks and also what process goes on in an ATM when we insert our card. I learned about databases with a very good hands on using the native sqlite3 library available with python. I also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number.
